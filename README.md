This is a simple mod for Crusader Kings III (CK3) that I made to fix a persistent issue with the game's multiplayer. 

Since the release of the DLC 'Roads to Power' in 2024, any time one player joins a multiplayer lobby, the House/family names of all characters in the game display as empty strings for every other player. My friends and I found that these names reappeared if they were manually set after all players had joined. This mod simply adds a decision that, when triggered, iterates over all characters in the game and sets the name of their House to itself.

Currently, this overwrites dynasty prefixes tied to titles (of, de, von, etc.) and does not affect Houses with no living members.
