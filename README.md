This is a simple mod for Crusader Kings III (CK3) that I made to fix a persistent issue with the game's multiplayer. 

Since the release of the DLC 'Roads to Power' in 2024, any time one player joins a multiplayer lobby, the House/family names of all characters in the game display as empty strings for every other player. My friends and I found that these names reappeared if they were manually set after all players had joined. 

This mod adds two decisions: one to store working House names before players join the lobby, and one to restore these House names once all players have joined.

Currently, dynasty prefixes tied to titles (of, de, von, etc.) are included as part of the restored House name. The mod does not affect Houses with no living members.
